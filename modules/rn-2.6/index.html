</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="technical-changes-26_forklift">Technical changes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release has the following technical changes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Simplified the creation of vSphere providers</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, users had to specify a fingerprint when creating a vSphere provider. This required users to retrieve the fingerprint from the server that vCenter runs on. Forklift no longer requires this fingerprint as an input, but rather computes it from the specified certificate in the case of a secure connection or automatically retrieves it from the server that runs vCenter/ESXi in the case of an insecure connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Redesigned the migration plan creation dialog</div>
<p>The user interface console has improved the process of creating a migration plan. The new migration plan dialog enables faster creation of migration plans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It includes only the minimal settings that are required, while you can confirgure advanced settings separately. The new dialog also provides defaults for network and storage mappings, where applicable. The new dialog can also be invoked from the the <code>Provider</code> &gt; <code>Virtual Machines</code> tab, after selecting the virtual machines to migrate. It also better aligns with the user experience in the OCP console.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title"><code>virtual machine preferences</code> have replaced {ocp-name} templates</div>
<p>The <code>virtual machine preferences</code> have replaced {ocp-name} templates. Forklift currently falls back to using {ocp-name} templates when a relevant preference is not available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Custom mappings of guest operating system type to virtual machine preference can be configured using <code>config</code> maps. This is in order to use custom virtual machine preferences, or to support more guest operating system types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Full support for migration from OVA</div>
<p>Migration from OVA moves from being a Technical Preview and is now a fully supported feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">The VM is posted with its desired <code>Running</code> state</div>
<p>Forklift creates the VM with its desired <code>Running</code> state on the target provider, instead of creating the VM and then running it as an additional operation. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-794">(MTV-794)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">The <code>must-gather</code> logs can now be loaded only by using the CLI</div>
<p>The Forklift web console can no longer download logs. With this update, you must download <code>must-gather</code> logs by using CLI commands. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/must-gather-operator">Must Gather Operator</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Forklift no longer runs <code>pvc-init</code> pods when migrating from vSphere</div>
<p>Forklift no longer runs <code>pvc-init</code> pods during cold migration from a vSphere provider to the {ocp-name} cluster that Forklift is deployed on. However, in other flows where data volumes are used, they are set with the <code>cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.bind.immediate.requested</code> annotation, and CDI runs first-consume pods for storage classes with volume binding mode <code>WaitForFirstConsumer</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="new-features-and-enhancements-26_forklift">New features and enhancements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This part provides features and enhancements introduced in Forklift 2.6:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration from vSphere over a secure connection</div>
<p>You can now specify a CA certificate that can be used to authenticate the server that runs vCenter or ESXi, depending on the specified SDK endpoint of the vSphere provider. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-530">(MTV-530)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration to or from a remote {ocp-name} over a secure connection</div>
<p>You can now specify a CA certificate that can be used to authenticate the API server of a remote {ocp-name} cluster. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-728">(MTV-728)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration from an ESXi server without going through vCenter</div>
<p>Forklift enables the configuration of vSphere providers with the SDK of ESXi. You need to select ESXi as the Endpoint type of the vSphere provider and specify the URL of the SDK of the ESXi server. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-514">(MTV-514)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration of image-based VMs from {osp}</div>
<p>Forklift supports the migration of VMs that were created from images in {osp}. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-644">(MTV-644)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration of VMs with Fibre Channel LUNs from oVirt</div>
<p>Forklift supports migrations of VMs that are set with Fibre Channel (FC) LUNs from oVirt. As with other LUN disks, you need to ensure the {ocp-name} nodes have access to the FC LUNs. During the migrations, the FC LUNs are detached from the source VMs in oVirt and attached to the migrated VMs in {ocp-name}. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-659">(MTV-659)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Preserve CPU types of VMs that are migrated from oVirt</div>
<p>Forklift sets the CPU type of migrated VMs in {ocp-name} with their custom CPU type in oVirt. In addition, a new option was added to migration plans that are set with oVirt as a source provider to preserve the original CPU types of source VMs. When this option is selected, Forklift identifies the CPU type based on the cluster configuration and sets this CPU type for the migrated VMs, for which the source VMs are not set with a custom CPU. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-547">(MTV-547)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Validation for RHEL 6 guest operating system is now available when migrating VMs with RHEL 6 guest operating system</div>
<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 does not support RHEL 6 as a guest operating system. Therefore, RHEL 6 is not supported in {ocp-name} Virtualization. With this update, a validation of RHEL 6 guest operating system was added to {ocp-name} Virtualization. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-413">(MTV413)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Automatic retrieval of CA certificates for the provider&#8217;s URL in the console</div>
<p>The ability to retrieve CA certificates, which was available in previous versions, has been restored. The <code>vSphere Verify certificate</code> option is in the <code>add-provider</code> dialog. This option was removed in the transition to the OKD console and has now been added to the console. This functionality is also available for oVirt, {osp}, and {ocp-name} providers now. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-737">(MTV-737)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Validation of a specified VDDK image</div>
<p>Forklift validates the availability of a VDDK image that is specified for a vSphere provider on the target {ocp-name} name as part of the validation of a migration plan. Forklift also checks whether the <code>libvixDiskLib.so</code> symbolic link (symlink) exists within the image. If the validation fails, the migration plan cannot be started. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-618">(MTV-618)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Add a warning and partial support for TPM</div>
<p>Forklift presents a warning when attempting to migrate a VM that is set with a TPM device from oVirt or vSphere. The migrated VM in {ocp-name} would be set with a TPM device but without the content of the TPM device on the source environment. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-378">(MTV-378)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Plans that failed to migrate VMs can now be edited</div>
<p>With this update, you can edit plans that have failed to migrate any VMs. Some plans fail or are canceled because of incorrect network and storage mappings. You can now edit these plans until they succeed. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-779">(MTV-779)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Validation rules are now available for OVA</div>
<p>The validation service includes default validation rules for virtual machines from the Open Virtual Appliance (OVA). <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-669">(MTV-669)</a></p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="resolved-issues-26_forklift">Resolved issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release has the following resolved issues:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">VMs with multiple disks that are migrated from vSphere and OVA files are not being fully copied</div>
<p>In Forklift 2.6.0, there was a problem in copying VMs with multiple disks from VMware vSphere and from OVA files. The migrations appeared to succeed but all the disks were transferred to the same PV in the target environment while other disks were empty. In some cases, bootable disks were overridden, so the VM could not boot. In other cases, data from the other disks was missing. The problem was resolved in Forklift 2.6.1. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1067">(MTV-1067)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migrating VMs from one OKD cluster to another fails due to a timeout</div>
<p>In Forklift 2.6.0,  migrations from one OKD cluster to another failed when the time to transfer the disks of a VM exceeded the time to live (TTL) of the Export API in {ocp-name}, which was set to 2 hours by default. The problem was resolved in Forklift 2.6.1 by setting the default TTL of the Export API to 12 hours, which greatly reduces the possibility of an expiration of the Export API. Additionally, you can increase or decrease the TTL setting as needed. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1052">(MTV-1052)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Forklift forklift-controller pod crashes when receiving a disk without a datastore</div>
<p>Previously, if a VM was configured with a disk that was on a datastore that was no longer available in vSphere at the time a migration was attempted, the <code>forklift-controller</code> crashed, rendering Forklift unusable. In Forklift 2.6.1, Forklift presents a critical validation for VMs with such disks, informing users of the problem, and the <code>forklift-controller</code> no longer crashes, although it cannot transfer the disk. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1029">(MTV-1029)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Deleting an OVA provider automatically also deletes the PV</div>
<p>In the earlier versions of Forklift, the PV was not removed when the OVA provider was deleted. This has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0, and the PV is automatically deleted when the OVA provider is deleted. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-848">(MTV-848)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Fix for data being lost when migrating VMware VMs with snapshots</div>
<p>In the earlier versions of Forklift, when migrating a VM that has a snapshot from VMware, the VM that was created in {ocp-name} Virtualization contained the data in the snapshot but not the latest data of the VM. This has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0.  <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-447">(MTV-447)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Canceling and deleting a failed migration plan does not clean up the <code>populate</code> pods and PVC</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when you canceled and deleted a failed migration plan, and after creating a PVC and spawning the <code>populate</code> pods, the <code>populate</code> pods and PVC were not deleted. You had to delete the pods and PVC manually. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-678">(MTV-678)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">OKD to OKD migrations require the cluster version to be 4.13 or later</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when migrating from OKD to OKD, the version of the source provider cluster had to be OKD version 4.13 or later. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0, with validation being shown when migrating from versions of {ocp-name} before 4.13. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-734">(MTV-734)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Multiple storage domains from RHV were always mapped to a single storage class</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, multiple disks from different storage domains were always mapped to a single storage class, regardless of the storage mapping that was configured. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1008">(MTV-1008)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Firmware detection by virt-v2v</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, a VM that was migrated from an OVA that did not include the firmware type in its OVF configuration was set with UEFI. This was incorrect for VMs that were configured with BIOS. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0, as Forklift now consumes the firmware that is detected by <code>virt-v2v</code> during the conversion of the disks. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-759">(MTV-759)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Creating a host secret requires validation of the secret before creation of the host</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when configuring a transfer network for vSphere hosts, the console plugin created the <code>Host</code> CR before creating its secret. The secret should be specified first in order to validate it before the <code>Host</code> CR is posted. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-868">(MTV-868)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">When adding OVA provider a <code>ConnectionTestFailed</code> message appears</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, when adding an OVA provider, the error message <code>ConnectionTestFailed</code> instantly appeared, although the provider had been created successfully. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-671">(MTV-671)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">RHV provider <code>ConnectionTestSucceeded</code> True response from the wrong URL</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, the <code>ConnectionTestSucceeded</code> condition was set to <code>True</code> even when the URL was different than the API endpoint for the RHV Manager. This issue has been resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-740">(MTV-740)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Migration does not fail when a vSphere Data Center is nested inside a folder</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, migrating a VM that is placed in a Data Center that is stored directly under the <code>/vcenter</code> in vSphere succeeded. However, it failed when the Data Center was stored inside a folder. This issue was resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-796">(MTV-796)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">The OVA inventory watcher detects deleted files</div>
<p>The OVA inventory watcher detects files changes, including deleted files. Updates from the <code>ova-provider-server</code> pod are now sent every five minutes to the <code>forklift-controller</code> pod that updates the inventory. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-733">(MTV-733)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Unclear error message when Forklift fails to build or create a PVC</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, the error logs lacked clear information to identify the reason for a failure to create a PV on a destination storage class that does not have a configured storage profile. This issue was resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-928">(MTV-928)</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Plans stay indefinitely in the <code>CopyDisks</code> phase when there is an outdated ovirtvolumepopulator</div>
<p>In earlier releases of Forklift, an earlier failed migration could have left an outdated <code>ovirtvolumepopulator</code>. When starting a new plan for the same VM to the same project,  the <code>CreateDataVolumes</code> phase did not create populator PVCs when transitioning to <code>CopyDisks</code>, causing the <code>CopyDisks</code> phase to stay indefinitely. This issue was resolved in Forklift 2.6.0. <a href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-929">(MTV-929)</a></p>
