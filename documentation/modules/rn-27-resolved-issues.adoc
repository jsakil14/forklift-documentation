== Resolved issues 2.7.2

.VMNetworksNotMapped error occurs after creating a plan from the UI with the source provider set to {virt}

In earlier releases of {project-short}, after creating a plan with an {virt} source provider, the Migration Plan failed with the error `The plan is not ready - VMNetworksNotMapped`. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1201[(MTV-1201)]

.Migration Plan for {virt} to {virt} missing the source namespace causing VMNetworkNotMapped error

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when creating a Migration Plan for an {virt} to {virt} migration using the Plan Creation Form, the network map generated was missing the source namespace, which caused a `VMNetworkNotMapped` error on the plan. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1297[(MTV-1297)]

.DV, PVC, and PV are not cleaned up and removed if the migration plan is Archived and Deleted

In earlier releases of {project-short}, the DataVolume (DV), PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), and PersistentVolume (PV) continued to exist after the migration plan was archived and deleted. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1477[(MTV-1477)]

.Other migrations are halted from starting as the scheduler is waiting for the complete VM to get transferred

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when warm migrating a virtual machine (VM) that has several disks, you had to wait for the complete VM to get migrated, and the scheduler was halted until all the disks finished before the migration would be started. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1537[(MTV-1537)]

.Warm migration is not functioning as expected

In earlier releases of {project-short}, warm migration did not function as expected. When running the warm migration with VMs larger than the MaxInFlight disks, the VMs over this number did not start the migration until the cutover. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1543[(MTV-1543)]

.Migration hanging due to error: virt-v2v: error: -i libvirt: expecting a libvirt guest name

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when attempting to migrate a VMware VM with a non-compliant Kubernetes name, the Openshift console returned a warning that the VM would be renamed. However, after starting the Migration Plan, it hangs since the migration pod is in an `Error` state. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1555[(MTV-1555)]

.VMs are not migrated if they have more disks than MAX_VM_INFLIGHT

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when migrating the VM using the warm migration, if there were more disks than the `MAX_VM_INFLIGHT` the VM was not scheduled and the migration was not started. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1573[(MTV-1573)]

.Migration Plan returns an error even when Changed Block Tracking (CBT) is enabled

In earlier releases of {project-short}, when running a VM in VMware, if the  CBT flag was enabled while the VM was running by adding both `ctkEnabled=TRUE` and `scsi0:0.ctkEnabled=TRUE` parameters, an error message `Danger alert:The plan is not ready - VMMissingChangedBlockTracking` was returned, and the migration plan was prevented from working. This issue has been resolved in {project-short} 2.7.2. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1576[(MTV-1576)]
