.VMs with Secure Boot enabled might not be migrated automatically

Virtual machines (VMs) with Secure Boot enabled currently might not be migrated automatically. This is because Secure Boot, a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to ensure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), would prevent the VMs from booting on the destination provider. 

Workaround: The current workaround is to disable Secure Boot on the destination.
